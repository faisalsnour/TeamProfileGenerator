# Team Profile Generator

## The purpose:

To build a Node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team, then generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person

## Features:

The command-line application does the following:

1. The application uses [Jest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest) for running the unit tests and [Inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer) for collecting input from the user.
2. It uses four different classes to store and display data; Employee, Manager, Engineer, and Intern
3. It generates an html file once the user finish building a team

## Screenshots:

The following pictures show the application's appearance and functionality:
